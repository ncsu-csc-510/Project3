# 🚀 Better Software Design  

CookBook is designed with scalability, safety, and reliability in mind. The software architecture includes modern solutions to ensure a seamless experience for users.

### Scalability Enhancements  
- **[Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/blob/main/docs/Scalability.md#content-delivery-network)**: Accelerates content delivery by distributing data globally.  
- **[Load Balancing](https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/blob/main/docs/Scalability.md#load-balancing-on-cloudflare)**: Ensures optimal resource utilization and improves availability.  
- **[Cache](https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/blob/main/docs/Scalability.md#cache)**: Reduces latency and increases speed by caching frequently accessed content.  

### Safety Enhancements  
- **[Domain](https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/blob/main/docs/Safety.md#domain)**: Ensures secure domain configurations.  
- **[SSL/TLS](https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/blob/main/docs/Safety.md#ssltls)**: Encrypts communication between users and the server for secure data transfer.  
- **[DDoS Protection](https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/blob/main/docs/Safety.md#ddos-protection)**: Protects against distributed denial-of-service attacks to ensure site reliability.

# 🌐 Access the Website  

Access CookBook directly via this link: [Cook Book](https://cookbook-alpha.vercel.app/).  

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting  
If the page fails to load, you can try the following:  
- Switch to a different network environment (e.g., home network or mobile hotspot).  
- Some users may experience DNS resolution failures under NC State's network due to DNS server issues.  

If problems persist, follow the installation instructions below to run CookBook locally.

# 🛠️Installations  

## Prerequisites  
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/cloud)**: Create a cluster and generate the DB URL, username, and password.

## Old Functions
- This is the CookBook HomePage that should automatically open in a browser after executing the command: 'npm start'
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/HomePage.PNG)

<br>

- The user can use the search bar to enter the ingredients one by one, and then proceed by clicking the arrow on the right.
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/SearchBar.PNG)

<br>

- The user would then be redirected to the page showing the recipe suggestions.
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/SearchResults.PNG)

<br>

- The details of a recipe can be viewed by simple clicking on a recipe from the list of recipes being displayed.
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/RecipeDetails.PNG)

<br><br>


- Start the App by URL.
![case](assets/HomePage_new.png)

<br>


- Above content mentions that users may manually input keyword, and click on 'search tag' to create some keyword search tags to search recepies. Besides, users may also click on some "food tags" to search receipes without specific input. For example, we may select "milk" tag:

![case](assets/tagSearch1.jpg)

<br>

- Then, we may have results shown as below:

![case](assets/tagSearch2.jpg)

<br>

- What is more, if users are not sure that tags to be chosen, they are able to use sliders to set some values for [Calorie, Fat, Suger, Protain]. The filtered recepies will be shown after using this kind of search. For example, if we want receipes that fulfill some requirements as:

![case](assets/filterSearch1.png)

<br>

- As former example cases, filtered results are displayed:

![case](assets/filterSearch2.png)
