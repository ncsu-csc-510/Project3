# 🚀 Better Software Design

My Cookbook is designed with **scalability**, **safety**, and **reliability** in mind. We use modern solutions such as:

- **CDN & Load Balancing**: Faster content delivery and improved availability.  
- **SSL/TLS & DDoS Protection**: Secure data transfer and protection against malicious attacks.  
- **Caching**: Reduces latency and speeds up your recipe searches.  

For a more detailed breakdown, see our [Scalability](docs/Scalability.md) and [Safety](docs/Safety.md) documentation.

# 🌐 Access the Website  

Access CookBook directly via this link: [Cook Book](https://cookbook-alpha.vercel.app/).  

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting  
If the page fails to load, you can try the following:  
- Switch to a different network environment (e.g., home network or mobile hotspot).  
- Some users may experience DNS resolution failures under NC State's network due to DNS server issues.  

If problems persist, follow the installation instructions below to run CookBook locally.  

---

# 🛠️Installations  

## Prerequisites  
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/cloud)**: Create a cluster and generate the DB URL, username, and password.  
- **[GROQ](https://groq.com/)**: Create an API key.  
- **Create a `.env` file** in the `api` folder with the following details:  
```env
ATLAS_URI = ...
DATABASE = cookbook
GROQ_API_KEY = ...
PORT = 8000

```
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
*   (Optional) [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pytest 7.4.4](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing the API
*   (Optional) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm) for frontend testing

## 📊 Dataset
You can find the dataset used for this project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12CZFb7Ugmiw9zQ7M_qpRsn7pmaV1zW0c/view?usp=sharing)

## 🔧 Backend Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server:

1. **Navigate to the API folder**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   
2. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the application server**:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload



### 🛠️Trouble Shooting

In case you run into any issues running the above commands, some operating systems may require you to use `python3` instead of `python` and `pip3` instead of `pip`.<br><br>

## 🎨Frontend Installation

To set up the front end React app, do:
1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend

   
2. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. **If the above command fails, use the following alternative:**:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   
4. **Start the React app:**
   ```bash
   npm start

<!--## Old Functions
- This is the CookBook HomePage that should automatically open in a browser after executing the command: 'npm start'
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/HomePage.PNG)

<br>

- The user can use the search bar to enter the ingredients one by one, and then proceed by clicking the arrow on the right.
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/SearchBar.PNG)

<br>

- The user would then be redirected to the page showing the recipe suggestions.
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/SearchResults.PNG)

<br>

- The details of a recipe can be viewed by simple clicking on a recipe from the list of recipes being displayed.
  <br><br>

![HomePage](assets/RecipeDetails.PNG)

<br><br>


- Start the App by URL.
![case](assets/HomePage_new.png)

<br>


- Above content mentions that users may manually input keyword, and click on 'search tag' to create some keyword search tags to search recepies. Besides, users may also click on some "food tags" to search receipes without specific input. For example, we may select "milk" tag:

![case](assets/tagSearch1.jpg)

<br>

- Then, we may have results shown as below:

![case](assets/tagSearch2.jpg)

<br>

- What is more, if users are not sure that tags to be chosen, they are able to use sliders to set some values for [Calorie, Fat, Suger, Protain]. The filtered recepies will be shown after using this kind of search. For example, if we want receipes that fulfill some requirements as:

![case](assets/filterSearch1.png)

<br>

- As former example cases, filtered results are displayed:

![case](assets/filterSearch2.png)
